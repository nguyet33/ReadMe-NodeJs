# ReadMe-NodeJs

## User Story
```md
AS A web developer
I WANT create a README file using NodeJs
SO THAT I can share my work with others for collaborations.
```
## Description
The motivation behind this project was the beginning to learn the back-end of the fullstack WebDev. In this particular assignement, we learn how to use node.js to install certain packages that will allows programers to directly use javascript to code the back-end of things isntead of for the browswer like we have been doing. In this assignment, we learn new syntax, new fucntion methods and install package to create a direct file. 

This solves the need of using a template.
